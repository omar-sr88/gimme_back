# README

Hello there! On my road to learning (and getting good at!) Ruby on Rails I started this little app to cover a couple of features by adding some standard functionalities.

Gimmeback is a simple webpage to add and track those books, games and other stuff you lend your friends.

Currently it uses:

* Ruby 2.2.5
* Ruby on Rails 5
* SQLite


So far the following are implemented

* User registration, email activation, login, 'remember me' , password recovery , info editing. User contact info
* Item registration , searching other users or creating recipient automatically as a guest, editing , returning the item, listing of open (users and friends) and returned items
* Progress bar indicating time until defined return date
* Creates simple message to recipient of item when item is created, lists all messages
* Tests for navigation, user related actions, item creation and lending

Next 

* I18n translations for pt-br and en-Us
* Email notification via SendGrid
* Friend List

* Improve CSS (Not particularly my cup of tea)
